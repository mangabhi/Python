'''Description : Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not.
The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence. Example: 0100,0011,1010,1001 Then the output should be: 1010 Notes: Assume the data is input by console.
'''
items = []
num = [x for x in input().split(',')]
for p in num:
    x = int(p, 2)
    if not x%5:
        items.append(p)
print(','.join(items))
